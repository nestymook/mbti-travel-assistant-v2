# Restaurant MCP Projects - Deployment Connectivity Fix Summary

## Overview

Applied the same connectivity fix that was implemented for `mbti-travel-planner-agent` to both restaurant MCP projects:
- `restaurant-search-mcp`
- `restaurant-search-result-reasoning-mcp`

## Issue Description

Both restaurant MCP deployment scripts had the same issue where `scripts/deploy_agentcore.py` would show:
```
✗ No endpoint information available
⚠️ Deployment completed with issues
```

This occurred even when deployments were successful because the connectivity test was treating Pydantic model responses as dictionaries.

## Root Cause

The issue was in two methods in `scripts/deploy_agentcore.py`:
1. `test_deployment_connectivity()` 
2. `monitor_deployment_status()`

Both methods were treating the status response from `self.agentcore_runtime.status()` as a dictionary, but it's actually a Pydantic model object.

## Solution Applied

### Fixed Methods

#### 1. test_deployment_connectivity()

**Before (Problematic Code):**
```python
def test_deployment_connectivity(self) -> bool:
    status_response = self.agentcore_runtime.status()
    
    if 'endpoint' not in status_response:  # ❌ This fails - can't use 'in' on Pydantic model
        print("✗ No endpoint information available")
        return False
```

**After (Fixed Code):**
```python
def test_deployment_connectivity(self) -> bool:
    status_response = self.agentcore_runtime.status()
    
    # Convert to dict if it's a Pydantic model
    if hasattr(status_response, 'model_dump'):
        status_dict = status_response.model_dump()
    else:
        status_dict = status_response
    
    if 'endpoint' not in status_dict:
        print("✗ No endpoint information available")
        return False
```

#### 2. monitor_deployment_status()

**Before (Problematic Code):**
```python
if hasattr(status_response, 'endpoint') and status_response.endpoint:
    endpoint_status = status_response.endpoint.get('status', 'UNKNOWN')
```

**After (Fixed Code):**
```python
# Convert to dict if it's a Pydantic model
if hasattr(status_response, 'model_dump'):
    status_dict = status_response.model_dump()
else:
    status_dict = status_response

if 'endpoint' in status_dict and status_dict['endpoint']:
    endpoint_status = status_dict['endpoint'].get('status', 'UNKNOWN')
```

## Files Modified

### restaurant-search-mcp
- `scripts/deploy_agentcore.py` - Fixed connectivity test and status monitoring methods
- `test_connectivity_fix.py` - Created test script to verify the fix

### restaurant-search-result-reasoning-mcp  
- `scripts/deploy_agentcore.py` - Fixed connectivity test and status monitoring methods
- `test_connectivity_fix.py` - Created test script to verify the fix

## Enhanced Output

The fixed connectivity test now provides detailed information:

**Before Fix:**
```
✗ No endpoint information available
```

**After Fix:**
```
✓ Endpoint ARN: arn:aws:bedrock-agentcore:us-east-1:209803798463:runtime/restaurant_search_mcp-ABC123/runtime-endpoint/DEFAULT
✓ Endpoint Name: DEFAULT
✓ Endpoint Status: READY
✓ Agent ARN: arn:aws:bedrock-agentcore:us-east-1:209803798463:runtime/restaurant_search_mcp-ABC123
✓ Agent Status: READY
✓ Deployment connectivity test passed
```

## Testing

To verify the fixes work correctly, run the test scripts:

### For restaurant-search-mcp:
```bash
cd restaurant-search-mcp
python test_connectivity_fix.py
```

### For restaurant-search-result-reasoning-mcp:
```bash
cd restaurant-search-result-reasoning-mcp
python test_connectivity_fix.py
```

### Check deployment status:
```bash
# For restaurant-search-mcp
cd restaurant-search-mcp
python scripts/deploy_agentcore.py --status-only

# For restaurant-search-result-reasoning-mcp
cd restaurant-search-result-reasoning-mcp
python scripts/deploy_agentcore.py --status-only
```

## Consistency Across Projects

This fix ensures all AgentCore deployment scripts across the MBTI Travel Assistant ecosystem handle Pydantic model responses consistently:

✅ **mbti-travel-planner-agent** - Fixed  
✅ **restaurant-search-mcp** - Fixed  
✅ **restaurant-search-result-reasoning-mcp** - Fixed  

## Resolution Date

**Applied**: October 7, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - All restaurant MCP deployment scripts now handle connectivity tests correctly

## Related Issues

This fix resolves the same underlying issue that was identified and fixed in:
- `mbti-travel-planner-agent/DEPLOYMENT_CONNECTIVITY_FIX_SUMMARY.md`

The root cause was consistent across all projects using the bedrock-agentcore-starter-toolkit, where status responses are Pydantic models rather than plain dictionaries.
