# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Gateway that directly exposes existing MCP servers to AgentCore agents and foundation models. The Gateway provides native MCP protocol routing to existing MCP servers (restaurant-search-mcp, restaurant-reasoning-mcp, and mbti-travel-assistant-mcp) without requiring protocol conversion.

The AgentCore Gateway serves as an MCP protocol router, connecting AgentCore agents directly to existing MCP servers through native MCP communication. This eliminates the need for HTTP-to-MCP conversion and provides full MCP protocol functionality including streaming, rich metadata, and native error handling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a foundation model or AI agent, I want to access restaurant search and reasoning capabilities through native MCP protocol via the AgentCore Gateway, so that I can discover and use these tools with full MCP functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I query the AgentCore Gateway for available tools THEN the system SHALL expose MCP tools from registered MCP servers
2. WHEN I call an MCP tool through the Gateway THEN the system SHALL route the request directly to the appropriate MCP server using native MCP protocol
3. WHEN the MCP server returns data THEN the system SHALL forward the native MCP response without conversion
4. WHEN the underlying MCP server is unavailable THEN the system SHALL return appropriate MCP error responses with circuit breaker functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the AgentCore Gateway to appear in the Bedrock AgentCore console with proper monitoring of MCP servers, so that I can manage MCP server routing through the AWS console.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to the Bedrock AgentCore console THEN the system SHALL display the Gateway in the Gateways section
2. WHEN I view the Gateway details THEN the system SHALL show the connected MCP servers and their health status
3. WHEN I monitor the Gateway THEN the system SHALL provide metrics on MCP tool usage, success rates, and performance
4. WHEN any MCP server is unhealthy THEN the system SHALL reflect this in the Gateway status and route traffic to healthy servers

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want the AgentCore Gateway to properly authenticate MCP communications, so that security is maintained in native MCP protocol routing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Gateway communicates with MCP servers THEN the system SHALL use proper MCP authentication mechanisms
2. WHEN AgentCore agents authenticate with the Gateway THEN the system SHALL validate their credentials before forwarding MCP requests
3. WHEN the Gateway forwards MCP requests THEN the system SHALL include proper authentication context for the MCP servers
4. WHEN authentication fails at any level THEN the system SHALL return appropriate MCP error responses

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a foundation model or AI agent, I want to discover and use restaurant search and reasoning tools through native MCP protocol via the AgentCore Gateway, so that I can integrate these capabilities with full MCP functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call the search_restaurants_by_district MCP tool THEN the system SHALL route the request to the restaurant-search-mcp server using native MCP protocol
2. WHEN I call the search_restaurants_by_meal_type MCP tool THEN the system SHALL route the request to the restaurant-search-mcp server using native MCP protocol
3. WHEN I call the search_restaurants_combined MCP tool THEN the system SHALL route the request to the restaurant-search-mcp server using native MCP protocol
4. WHEN I call the recommend_restaurants MCP tool THEN the system SHALL route the request to the restaurant-reasoning-mcp server using native MCP protocol
5. WHEN I call the analyze_restaurant_sentiment MCP tool THEN the system SHALL route the request to the restaurant-reasoning-mcp server using native MCP protocol
6. WHEN I call MBTI travel planning tools THEN the system SHALL route the request to the mbti-travel-assistant-mcp server using native MCP protocol

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to deploy the AgentCore Gateway using AWS CLI or CloudFormation, so that MCP server routing can be managed as infrastructure-as-code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create the Gateway THEN the system SHALL use AWS CLI commands to configure the Gateway with MCP server endpoints
2. WHEN the Gateway is created THEN the system SHALL automatically appear in the Bedrock AgentCore console
3. WHEN I update the Gateway configuration THEN the system SHALL support updating MCP server endpoints and routing rules
4. WHEN the Gateway is deployed THEN the system SHALL connect to existing MCP servers (restaurant-search-mcp, restaurant-reasoning-mcp, mbti-travel-assistant-mcp)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an MCP client, I want comprehensive error handling when using tools through the AgentCore Gateway, so that I can handle failures gracefully with native MCP error responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid parameters are provided to MCP tools THEN the system SHALL forward MCP validation errors from the target MCP server
2. WHEN the underlying MCP server is unavailable THEN the system SHALL return MCP service unavailable errors with circuit breaker functionality
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return native MCP authentication error responses
4. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return appropriate MCP rate limiting errors

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a foundation model using the AgentCore Gateway, I want comprehensive tool metadata and descriptions through native MCP protocol, so that I can understand when and how to use each restaurant search and reasoning tool effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I query the Gateway for available tools THEN the system SHALL aggregate and provide detailed MCP tool descriptions from all registered MCP servers
2. WHEN I receive tool metadata THEN the system SHALL include native MCP tool schemas, validation rules, and examples from the source MCP servers
3. WHEN I need to understand tool purposes THEN the system SHALL provide rich MCP tool descriptions including use case scenarios and MBTI personality integration guidance
4. WHEN I process tool responses THEN the system SHALL return native MCP responses with full protocol functionality including streaming support

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the AgentCore Gateway to work alongside existing MCP servers, so that both direct MCP access and gateway-routed access are available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clients access MCP servers directly THEN the system SHALL continue to support direct MCP connections
2. WHEN the Gateway is deployed THEN the system SHALL provide centralized MCP routing without disrupting existing MCP server functionality
3. WHEN both Gateway and direct MCP access are used THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent MCP protocol behavior and authentication
4. WHEN the Gateway configuration changes THEN the system SHALL not require changes to the underlying MCP servers

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the AgentCore Gateway to perform comprehensive status checks for restaurant-search-mcp and restaurant-search-result-reasoning-mcp services, so that I can monitor the health and availability of these specific MCP servers through the Gateway.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Gateway is configured THEN the system SHALL include restaurant-search-mcp and restaurant-search-result-reasoning-mcp as named MCP server configurations
2. WHEN the Gateway performs health checks THEN the system SHALL check the status of restaurant-search-mcp on its configured endpoint and port
3. WHEN the Gateway performs health checks THEN the system SHALL check the status of restaurant-search-result-reasoning-mcp on its configured endpoint and port
4. WHEN I access the Gateway health endpoint THEN the system SHALL report the individual status of restaurant-search-mcp and restaurant-search-result-reasoning-mcp services
5. WHEN I access the Gateway metrics endpoint THEN the system SHALL provide detailed metrics for restaurant-search-mcp and restaurant-search-result-reasoning-mcp including response times and failure rates
6. WHEN either restaurant-search-mcp or restaurant-search-result-reasoning-mcp is unhealthy THEN the system SHALL reflect this in the overall Gateway health status and route traffic accordingly
7. WHEN the Gateway console integration is enabled THEN the system SHALL display the status of restaurant-search-mcp and restaurant-search-result-reasoning-mcp services individually in the AgentCore console
