# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing status check implementation for MCP servers by implementing comprehensive health monitoring using both MCP tools/list requests and RESTful API requests. The enhancement builds upon the existing status check functionality in restaurant-search-mcp and restaurant-search-result-reasoning-mcp servers to provide more robust and comprehensive health monitoring capabilities.

The enhanced status check system will utilize dual monitoring approaches: native MCP protocol health checks through tools/list requests and traditional HTTP REST API health checks. This dual approach ensures comprehensive monitoring coverage and provides fallback mechanisms when one monitoring method is unavailable.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the status check system to use MCP tools/list requests to verify MCP server health, so that I can monitor the actual MCP protocol functionality and tool availability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the status check system performs health checks THEN the system SHALL send MCP tools/list JSON-RPC 2.0 requests to each configured MCP server
2. WHEN an MCP tools/list request is sent THEN the system SHALL validate the JSON-RPC 2.0 response format and verify the presence of expected tools
3. WHEN the MCP server responds with tools/list data THEN the system SHALL verify that expected tools (search_restaurants_by_district, recommend_restaurants, etc.) are present and properly formatted
4. WHEN the MCP tools/list request fails THEN the system SHALL record the failure with appropriate error details and response time metrics
5. WHEN the MCP tools/list response is invalid THEN the system SHALL log validation errors and mark the server as unhealthy

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the status check system to use RESTful API requests to monitor MCP server health endpoints, so that I can have comprehensive monitoring coverage using standard HTTP health check patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the status check system performs health checks THEN the system SHALL send HTTP GET requests to configured REST health endpoints for each MCP server
2. WHEN a REST health check request is sent THEN the system SHALL validate the HTTP response status code and response body format
3. WHEN the REST health endpoint responds THEN the system SHALL verify server metrics, circuit breaker states, and system health indicators
4. WHEN the REST health check fails THEN the system SHALL record HTTP error codes, response times, and failure details
5. WHEN the REST health endpoint is unavailable THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a monitoring system, I want to combine results from both MCP tools/list requests and RESTful API health checks, so that I can provide comprehensive health status with multiple validation points.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN both MCP and REST health checks are performed THEN the system SHALL aggregate results to determine overall server health status
2. WHEN MCP tools/list succeeds but REST health check fails THEN the system SHALL mark the server as DEGRADED with detailed status information
3. WHEN REST health check succeeds but MCP tools/list fails THEN the system SHALL mark the server as DEGRADED with MCP-specific error details
4. WHEN both MCP and REST health checks fail THEN the system SHALL mark the server as UNHEALTHY with comprehensive failure information
5. WHEN both MCP and REST health checks succeed THEN the system SHALL mark the server as HEALTHY with performance metrics from both checks

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want enhanced status check configuration options, so that I can customize monitoring behavior for different MCP servers and environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring status checks THEN the system SHALL support enabling/disabling MCP tools/list checks independently from REST health checks
2. WHEN configuring status checks THEN the system SHALL support different timeout values for MCP and REST health check requests
3. WHEN configuring status checks THEN the system SHALL support different retry policies for MCP and REST health check failures
4. WHEN configuring status checks THEN the system SHALL support custom expected tools lists for MCP tools/list validation
5. WHEN configuring status checks THEN the system SHALL support priority weighting between MCP and REST health check results

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a monitoring dashboard, I want detailed metrics from both MCP and REST health checks, so that I can display comprehensive server health information and performance trends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN health checks are performed THEN the system SHALL collect response time metrics separately for MCP tools/list and REST health checks
2. WHEN health checks are performed THEN the system SHALL track success/failure rates separately for MCP and REST monitoring methods
3. WHEN health checks are performed THEN the system SHALL record tool count and tool validation results from MCP tools/list responses
4. WHEN health checks are performed THEN the system SHALL capture HTTP status codes and response body metrics from REST health checks
5. WHEN metrics are requested THEN the system SHALL provide aggregated and individual metrics for both monitoring methods

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a circuit breaker system, I want enhanced failure detection using both MCP and REST health check results, so that I can make more informed decisions about server availability and traffic routing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN determining circuit breaker state THEN the system SHALL consider failure patterns from both MCP tools/list and REST health checks
2. WHEN MCP tools/list consistently fails but REST health checks succeed THEN the system SHALL open the circuit breaker for MCP traffic only
3. WHEN REST health checks consistently fail but MCP tools/list succeeds THEN the system SHALL implement degraded routing with MCP-only traffic
4. WHEN both MCP and REST health checks show consistent failures THEN the system SHALL open the circuit breaker completely
5. WHEN recovering from failures THEN the system SHALL require both MCP and REST health checks to succeed before closing the circuit breaker

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want enhanced REST endpoints that provide detailed status information from both MCP and REST health checks, so that I can access comprehensive monitoring data through standard HTTP APIs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request server status via REST API THEN the system SHALL return detailed results from both MCP tools/list and REST health checks
2. WHEN I request system metrics via REST API THEN the system SHALL provide separate metrics for MCP and REST monitoring methods
3. WHEN I request health check history via REST API THEN the system SHALL return timestamped results showing both MCP and REST check outcomes
4. WHEN I trigger manual health checks via REST API THEN the system SHALL perform both MCP tools/list and REST health checks and return combined results
5. WHEN I request server configuration via REST API THEN the system SHALL return the current MCP and REST health check configuration settings

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want backward compatibility with existing status check implementations, so that current monitoring systems continue to work while gaining enhanced capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the enhanced status check system is deployed THEN existing REST API endpoints SHALL continue to function with the same response formats
2. WHEN existing monitoring systems query health status THEN they SHALL receive compatible responses with additional enhanced data available
3. WHEN existing configuration files are used THEN the system SHALL support legacy configuration formats while enabling new enhanced features
4. WHEN existing circuit breaker logic is in use THEN it SHALL continue to function while benefiting from enhanced failure detection
5. WHEN existing alerting systems are configured THEN they SHALL continue to receive compatible status updates with enhanced detail available

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want proper authentication and authorization for both MCP tools/list requests and REST health check requests, so that monitoring traffic is properly secured and authenticated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing MCP tools/list health checks THEN the system SHALL include proper JWT authentication headers in MCP requests
2. WHEN performing REST health checks THEN the system SHALL include proper authentication credentials in HTTP requests
3. WHEN authentication fails for MCP requests THEN the system SHALL record authentication errors separately from connectivity failures
4. WHEN authentication fails for REST requests THEN the system SHALL distinguish between authentication failures and server unavailability
5. WHEN authentication tokens expire THEN the system SHALL implement automatic token refresh for both MCP and REST health checks

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a performance monitoring system, I want optimized concurrent health checking for both MCP and REST requests, so that monitoring overhead is minimized while maintaining comprehensive coverage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing health checks THEN the system SHALL execute MCP tools/list and REST health checks concurrently for each server
2. WHEN multiple servers are monitored THEN the system SHALL limit concurrent connections to prevent resource exhaustion
3. WHEN health checks are scheduled THEN the system SHALL distribute MCP and REST requests to avoid overwhelming servers
4. WHEN connection pools are managed THEN the system SHALL maintain separate pools for MCP and REST connections with appropriate limits
5. WHEN health check intervals are configured THEN the system SHALL coordinate timing between MCP and REST checks to optimize resource usage
