# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The MBTI Travel Planner Agent currently has access to multiple MCP tools from restaurant-search-mcp and restaurant-search-result-reasoning-mcp servers through AgentCore Runtime API calls. However, there is no clear guidance or intelligent orchestration system to help the agent choose the most appropriate tools for different user scenarios. This leads to suboptimal tool selection and potentially inefficient workflows.

This feature will implement an intelligent tool orchestration system that provides clear guidance to the agent on when and how to use different tools from the available MCP servers, ensuring optimal user experience and efficient resource utilization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Tool Selection Intelligence

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want intelligent guidance on which tools to use for different user requests, so that I can provide the most efficient and accurate responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent receives a user request THEN the system SHALL analyze the request intent and recommend appropriate tools
2. WHEN multiple tools could fulfill a request THEN the system SHALL prioritize tools based on efficiency and accuracy metrics
3. WHEN a tool selection decision is made THEN the system SHALL log the reasoning for observability
4. IF a user asks for restaurant search by location THEN the system SHALL recommend using search_restaurants_by_district or search_restaurants_combined tools
5. IF a user asks for meal-specific recommendations THEN the system SHALL recommend using search_restaurants_by_meal_type or search_restaurants_combined tools
6. IF a user provides restaurant data for analysis THEN the system SHALL recommend using recommend_restaurants or analyze_restaurant_sentiment tools

### Requirement 2: Workflow Orchestration

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to execute multi-step workflows that combine tools from different MCP servers, so that I can provide comprehensive responses to complex user requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests restaurant recommendations with location filtering THEN the system SHALL orchestrate search tools followed by reasoning tools
2. WHEN executing a multi-step workflow THEN the system SHALL pass data efficiently between tools
3. WHEN a workflow step fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback options or alternative approaches
4. WHEN a workflow completes THEN the system SHALL provide a consolidated response to the user
5. IF a user requests "restaurants in Central district for lunch with recommendations" THEN the system SHALL execute search_restaurants_combined followed by recommend_restaurants

### Requirement 3: Tool Performance Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor tool usage patterns and performance metrics, so that I can optimize the tool orchestration system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tools are invoked THEN the system SHALL track usage frequency, response times, and success rates
2. WHEN tool performance degrades THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust tool selection preferences
3. WHEN generating performance reports THEN the system SHALL include tool effectiveness metrics
4. IF a tool consistently fails THEN the system SHALL temporarily deprioritize it in selection algorithms
5. WHEN tools are available THEN the system SHALL perform health checks and update availability status

### Requirement 4: Context-Aware Tool Selection

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to consider user context and conversation history when selecting tools, so that I can provide personalized and contextually relevant responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting tools THEN the system SHALL consider previous user interactions and preferences
2. WHEN a user has MBTI type information THEN the system SHALL prioritize reasoning tools that can leverage this data
3. WHEN a user shows preference for specific districts THEN the system SHALL optimize search parameters accordingly
4. IF a user frequently asks about breakfast places THEN the system SHALL preemptively suggest meal-type filtering
5. WHEN conversation context indicates multi-day planning THEN the system SHALL recommend comprehensive search and reasoning workflows

### Requirement 5: Tool Documentation and Guidance

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want clear documentation about available tools and their optimal use cases, so that I can make informed decisions about tool selection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tools are registered THEN the system SHALL maintain comprehensive metadata about their capabilities
2. WHEN tool selection occurs THEN the system SHALL reference documented use cases and constraints
3. WHEN new tools are added THEN the system SHALL automatically update selection algorithms
4. IF tool schemas change THEN the system SHALL validate compatibility and update guidance
5. WHEN debugging tool issues THEN the system SHALL provide detailed tool capability information

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Fallbacks

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want robust error handling when tools fail, so that I can still provide useful responses to users even when some services are unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a primary tool fails THEN the system SHALL attempt alternative tools that can fulfill the same request
2. WHEN all relevant tools are unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide informative error messages with suggested alternatives
3. WHEN partial tool failures occur THEN the system SHALL complete the request with available tools and note limitations
4. IF the restaurant search MCP is down THEN the system SHALL inform users and offer general travel planning assistance
5. WHEN tool timeouts occur THEN the system SHALL implement progressive fallback strategies

### Requirement 7: Configuration and Customization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure tool selection preferences and orchestration rules, so that I can optimize the system for specific deployment scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN administrators SHALL be able to set tool priority rankings
2. WHEN deployment environments differ THEN the system SHALL support environment-specific tool configurations
3. WHEN business rules change THEN administrators SHALL be able to update orchestration logic without code changes
4. IF certain tools should be restricted THEN the system SHALL support access control and usage policies
5. WHEN A/B testing tool strategies THEN the system SHALL support configuration-driven experimentation

### Requirement 8: Integration with Existing AgentCore Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the tool orchestration system to integrate seamlessly with existing AgentCore monitoring and authentication systems, so that I can maintain operational consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tools are invoked THEN the system SHALL use existing AgentCore authentication mechanisms
2. WHEN monitoring tool usage THEN the system SHALL integrate with existing observability infrastructure
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL use existing error handling and logging systems
4. IF JWT authentication is required THEN the system SHALL leverage existing authentication managers
5. WHEN performance metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL use existing monitoring services

## Success Criteria

1. **Tool Selection Accuracy**: 95% of tool selections should be optimal for the given user request type
2. **Workflow Efficiency**: Multi-step workflows should complete 30% faster than manual tool chaining
3. **Error Recovery**: 90% of tool failures should be handled gracefully with appropriate fallbacks
4. **Performance Monitoring**: All tool invocations should be tracked with sub-100ms overhead
5. **User Satisfaction**: User requests should be fulfilled successfully 98% of the time when tools are available

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**: Tool selection decisions should be made within 50ms
2. **Scalability**: The system should support up to 100 concurrent tool orchestration workflows
3. **Reliability**: Tool orchestration should maintain 99.9% uptime
4. **Maintainability**: New tools should be integrable with less than 4 hours of development effort
5. **Observability**: All tool selection decisions and workflows should be fully traceable
