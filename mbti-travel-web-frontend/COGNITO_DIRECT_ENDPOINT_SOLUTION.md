# üéØ SOLUTION: Use Direct Cognito Endpoints (No Custom Domain Needed)

## üîç **Root Cause Identified**

The issue is with the **custom Hosted UI domain**, not the Cognito User Pool itself. The User Pool is working perfectly:

- ‚úÖ **User Pool**: `us-east-1_KePRX24Bn` - Working
- ‚úÖ **JWKS Endpoint**: `https://cognito-idp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/us-east-1_KePRX24Bn/.well-known/jwks.json` - Working
- ‚ùå **Custom Domain**: `restaurant-mcp-fixed-1759270016.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com` - Not working

## üí° **Solution: Use Direct Cognito Endpoints**

Instead of using a custom domain, we can use the **direct Cognito service endpoints** which are always available and don't require domain propagation.

### **Direct Endpoint URLs**

#### **Authorization Endpoint**
```
https://cognito-idp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/
```

#### **OAuth Endpoints**
```
Authorization: https://us-east-1_KePRX24Bn.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/authorize
Token:         https://us-east-1_KePRX24Bn.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/token
Login:         https://us-east-1_KePRX24Bn.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com/login
Logout:        https://us-east-1_KePRX24Bn.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com/logout
```

## üîß **Implementation Fix**

### **Option 1: Use User Pool ID as Domain (Recommended)**

Update your environment configuration to use the User Pool ID directly:

```bash
# Change from custom domain:
VITE_COGNITO_DOMAIN=restaurant-mcp-fixed-1759270016

# To User Pool ID:
VITE_COGNITO_DOMAIN=us-east-1_KePRX24Bn
```

### **Option 2: Delete Cus
