# Performance Monitoring and Metrics Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the performance monitoring and metrics system for the MBTI Travel Planner Tool Orchestration system. The implementation provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities for tool usage, health checking, and performance analysis.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Performance Monitor (`services/performance_monitor.py`)

The `PerformanceMonitor` class provides comprehensive performance tracking and metrics collection:

#### Key Features:
- **Tool Invocation Tracking**: Records response times, success rates, and error patterns
- **Workflow Execution Monitoring**: Tracks multi-step workflow performance
- **Performance Report Generation**: Creates detailed analysis reports with recommendations
- **Integration with AgentCore Monitoring**: Seamless integration with existing monitoring infrastructure
- **Performance Threshold Alerting**: Automatic alerts when performance degrades

#### Core Functionality:
```python
# Track tool invocations
performance_monitor.track_tool_invocation(
    tool=selected_tool,
    correlation_id="request_123",
    response_time_ms=1500.0,
    success=True,
    input_size=100,
    output_size=500
)

# Track workflow executions
performance_monitor.track_workflow_execution(
    workflow_id="search_and_recommend",
    correlation_id="workflow_456",
    execution_time_ms=3000.0,
    tools_used=["restaurant_search", "restaurant_reasoning"],
    success=True,
    steps_completed=3,
    total_steps=3
)

# Generate comprehensive reports
report = performance_monitor.generate_performance_report(
    time_window_minutes=60,
    include_recommendations=True
)
```

#### Metrics Collected:
- Tool invocation frequency and patterns
- Response times (min, max, mean, P50, P95, P99)
- Success and failure rates
- Error type breakdown
- Retry counts and fallback usage
- Workflow completion rates
- Performance trends over time

### 2. Orchestration Health Monitor (`services/orchestration_health_monitor.py`)

The `OrchestrationHealthMonitor` class provides continuous health monitoring for orchestration tools:

#### Key Features:
- **Continuous Health Checking**: Automated health checks for registered tools
- **Multiple Check Methods**: HTTP endpoints, synthetic tests for MCP tools
- **Automatic Status Updates**: Real-time tool status based on health check results
- **Alert Generation**: Configurable alerting for tool failures and degradation
- **Health Trend Analysis**: Historical health data and trend monitoring

#### Core Functionality:
```python
# Register tools for health monitoring
health_monitor.register_mcp_tool_health_check(
    tool_id="restaurant_search_mcp",
    tool_name="Restaurant Search MCP",
    mcp_endpoint="http://localhost:8080",
    check_interval_seconds=60
)

# Perform health checks
result = await health_monitor.perform_health_check("restaurant_search_mcp")

# Get health status
status = health_monitor.get_tool_health_status("restaurant_search_mcp")

# Get comprehensive health summary
summary = health_monitor.get_health_summary(time_window_minutes=60)
```

#### Health Status Levels:
- **HEALTHY**: Tool is functioning normally
- **DEGRADED**: Tool is working but with performance issues
- **UNHEALTHY**: Tool is failing or unavailable
- **UNKNOWN**: Health status cannot be determined
- **MAINTENANCE**: Tool is in maintenance mode

#### Alert Severity Levels:
- **INFO**: Informational alerts (e.g., recovery notifications)
- **WARNING**: Performance degradation alerts
- **ERROR**: Tool failure alerts
- **CRITICAL**: Critical system failures

### 3. Data Models and Types

- `PerformanceReport`: Comprehensive performance analysis

#### Health Monitoring:

- `ToolHealthStatus`: Health status enumeration

### 4. Integration Points

#### AgentCore Monitoring Integration:
- Seamless integration with existing `AgentCoreMonitoringService`
- Correlation ID tracking for request tracing
- Structured logging for observability
- Performance metrics forwarding

#### Error Handling Integration:
- Integration with orchestration error handling system
