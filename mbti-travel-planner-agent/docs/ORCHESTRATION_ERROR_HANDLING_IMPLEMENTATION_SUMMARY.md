context = error_handler.create_error_context(
    operation="tool_invocation",
    correlation_id="orch_123456",
    tool_id="restaurant_search_tool"
)

try:
    # Orchestration operation
    pass
except Exception as e:
    result = await error_handler.handle_error(e, context)
    # Handle recovery actions
    for action in result.recovery_actions:
        await error_handler.execute_recovery_action(action, context)
```

### Logging Usage
```python
from services.orchestration_logging_service import get_orchestration_logging_service

logging_service = get_orchestration_logging_service()

# Start operation tracking
correlation_id = logging_service.start_operation("restaurant_search_workflow")

# Log specific operations
logging_service.log_intent_analysis(request_text, intent, duration_ms)
logging_service.log_tool_selection(intent, selected_tools, duration_ms)
logging_service.log_workflow_execution(workflow_type, tools_used, duration_ms, success)

# End operation tracking
logging_service.end_operation(correlation_id, success=True)
