# Tool Selection System Implementation Summary

## Overview

The intelligent tool selection system has been successfully implemented for the MBTI Travel Planner Agent. This system provides sophisticated algorithms for selecting the most appropriate tools based on multiple criteria including capability matching, performance metrics, health status, and user context.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Core Tool Selection Logic (`tool_selector.py`)

**Key Features:**
- **Capability Matching**: Matches tools to user intents based on required and optional capabilities
- **Performance-Based Ranking**: Uses historical metrics to rank tools by success rate, response time, and throughput
- **Tool Compatibility Validation**: Validates that selected tools can work together in workflows
- **Configurable Selection Weights**: Allows customization of selection criteria importance

**Core Classes:**
- `ToolSelector`: Main tool selection engine
- `SelectionWeights`: Configuration for selection criteria weights
- `ToolRanking`: Detailed ranking information for tools
- `PerformanceMetrics`: Performance tracking and scoring

**Selection Criteria:**
- Capability match score (35% default weight)
- Performance score (25% default weight)  
- Health score (20% default weight)
- Context score (15% default weight)
- Compatibility score (5% default weight)

### 2. Advanced Selection Criteria (`advanced_tool_selector.py`)

**Enhanced Features:**
- **User Context Consideration**: Personalizes tool selection based on user preferences and history
- **Real-time Health Checking**: Monitors tool availability and health status
- **Intelligent Fallback Selection**: Identifies and ranks backup tools for failure scenarios
- **User Learning**: Adapts selection based on user feedback and usage patterns
- **Adaptive Weights**: Dynamically adjusts selection criteria based on user experience

**Advanced Classes:**
- `AdvancedToolSelector`: Extended tool selector with context awareness
- `UserPreferenceProfile`: User-specific preferences and learning data
- `FallbackStrategy`: Fallback tool identification and ranking
- `HealthCheckResult`: Health monitoring results

**Context Analysis Types:**
- MBTI personality-based selection
- Location preference consideration
- Time-of-day context awareness
- Conversation history analysis
- User feedback integration
- Usage pattern learning

### 3. Integration with Orchestration Engine

The tool selection system is fully integrated with the main orchestration engine:

```python
# Initialize advanced tool selector
self.tool_selector = AdvancedToolSelector(
    tool_registry=self.tool_registry,
    performance_window_minutes=self.config.performance_window_seconds // 60,
    health_check_strategy=HealthCheckStrategy.CACHED,
    enable_user_learning=True
)

# Use in orchestration workflow
selected_tools = await self.tool_selector.select_tools_with_context(
    intent=intent,
    user_context=user_context,
    max_tools=5,
    min_score_threshold=0.3,
    require_health_check=True
)
```

## Key Algorithms

### 1. Capability Matching Algorithm

```python
def calculate_capability_score(tool_metadata, intent):
    # Required capabilities (must have all)
    required_score = matches / total_required if required_capabilities else 1.0
    
    # Optional capabilities (bonus for having them)  
    optional_score = matches / total_optional if optional_capabilities else 0.0
    
    # Final score with bonus for additional capabilities
    final_score = (required_score * 0.8) + (optional_score * 0.2) + bonus
    return min(1.0, final_score)
```

### 2. Performance Scoring Algorithm

```python
def calculate_performance_score(metrics):
    score = (
        success_rate * 0.4 +
        (1.0 - normalized_response_time) * 0.3 +
        throughput_score * 0.15 +
        (1.0 - error_rate) * 0.10 +
        availability_score * 0.05
    )
    return max(0.0, min(1.0, score))
```

### 3. Context-Aware Scoring

The system analyzes multiple context types:

- **MBTI Context**: Matches tool capabilities with personality preferences
- **Location Context**: Prioritizes location-aware tools for geographic queries
- **Conversation Context**: Uses conversation history to identify relevant tools
- **Usage Patterns**: Learns from user behavior to improve future selections
- **Feedback Integration**: Incorporates user ratings and success feedback

### 4. Fallback Selection Algorithm

```python
def calculate_fallback_score(primary_tool, candidate_tool):
    overlap_ratio = capability_overlap / primary_capabilities
    health_score = get_health_score(candidate_tool)
    performance_score = get_performance_score(candidate_tool)
    
    fallback_confidence = (
        overlap_ratio * 0.4 +
        health_score * 0.3 +
        performance_score * 0.3 +
        user_preference_bonus
    )
    return fallback_confidence
```

    performance_weight: 0.25   # Historical performance importance  
    health_weight: 0.20        # Current health status importance
    context_weight: 0.15       # User context relevance importance
    compatibility_weight: 0.05 # Tool compatibility importance
```
