## Integration Points

### HTTP Client Integration
```python
# Automatic request/response logging
request_id = self.logging_service.log_http_request(method, url, headers, body)
self.logging_service.log_http_response(request_id, status_code, size, duration)

# Performance monitoring
self.logging_service.log_performance_metric(operation, duration, success)
```

### Error Handling Integration
```python
# Comprehensive error logging
self.logging_service.log_error(error, operation, context, include_stack_trace=True)

# Performance issue logging
self.logging_service.log_performance_issue(operation, duration, threshold)
```

### Health Check Integration
```python
# Health check monitoring
result = await self.health_service.check_endpoint_health(service_name)
self.logging_service.log_health_check(service_name, endpoint, status, response_time)
```

## Configuration Options

### Environment Variables
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
- `LOG_DIR`: Directory for log files (default: ./logs)
- `ENABLE_FILE_LOGGING`: Enable/disable file logging (default: true)
- `ENABLE_JSON_LOGGING`: Enable/disable JSON format (default: true)
- `HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL`: Health check interval in seconds (default: 300)
- `ENABLE_BACKGROUND_HEALTH_CHECKS`: Enable background health checks (default: true)

### Programmatic Configuration
```python
# Initialize logging service
logging_service = initialize_logging_service(
    service_name="mbti_travel_planner",
    log_level="INFO",
    log_dir="./logs",
    enable_file_logging=True,
    enable_json_logging=True
)

# Initialize health check service
health_service = initialize_health_check_service(
    environment="production",
    check_interval=300,
    enable_background_checks=True
)
```

## Log File Structure

The system creates separate log files for different types of events:

- **main.log**: General application logs
- **http.log**: HTTP request/response logs
- **performance.log**: Performance metrics and issues
- **health.log**: Health check results
- **errors.log**: Error logs with stack traces

## Monitoring Dashboard Data

The system provides dashboard-ready data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-03T18:31:01.462919",
  "overall_health": "healthy",
  "total_requests": 1250,
  "total_errors": 15,
  "services_monitored": 4,
  "performance_issues": 3,
  "metrics": {
    "counters": {...},
    "gauges": {...}
  },
  "health": {
    "services": {...},
    "summary": {...}
  },
  "performance": {
    "operations": {...},
    "http_requests": {...}
  }
}
```

## Testing Coverage
