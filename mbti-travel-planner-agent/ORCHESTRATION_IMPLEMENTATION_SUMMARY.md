  tool_selection:
    performance_weight: 0.4
    health_weight: 0.3
    capability_weight: 0.3
    max_fallback_tools: 2
  
  workflow_engine:
    max_concurrent_workflows: 50
    step_timeout_seconds: 30
    max_retries: 3
  
  performance_monitoring:
    enable_metrics_collection: true
    health_check_interval_seconds: 30
  
  error_handling:
    enable_circuit_breaker: true
    circuit_breaker_failure_threshold: 5

tools:
  restaurant_search:
    priority: 1
    capabilities: ["search_by_district", "search_by_meal_type", "combined_search"]
  
  restaurant_reasoning:
    priority: 1
    capabilities: ["recommend_restaurants", "analyze_sentiment", "mbti_personalization"]
```
